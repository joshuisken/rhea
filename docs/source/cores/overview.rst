Cores
=====
The following is a list of currently implemented cores.

FIFO
----
Various synchronous and asynchronous FIFO implementations.

.. @todo mixed size FIFOs, need to infer 1-bit primitives
.. and use these to be the mixed-size FIFO.


fpgalink
--------

This is a MyHDL implementation of the HDL for the *fpgalink*
project.  The fpgalink HDL core can be instantiated into
a design:

.. code-block:: python

    from rhea.cores.usbext import m_fpgalink_fx2

    # ...
    # fpgalink interface
    g_fli = m_fpgalink_fx2(clock,reset,fx2bus,flbus)

    # ...

For simulation and verification the *fpgalink* interface can be
stimulated using the FX2 model and high-level access functions:

.. code-block:: python

   from rhea.models.usbext import fpgalink_host
   from rhea.cores.usbext import fpgalink
   from rhea.cores.usbext import m_fpgalink_fx2

   # instantiate the components, etc (see examples in example dir)
   # ...
   # use high-level accessors to
   fh.WriteAddress(1, [0xC3])     # write 0xCE to address 1
   fh.WriteAddress(0, [1,2,3,4])  # write 1,2,3,4 to address 0
   rb = fh.ReadAddress(1)         # read address 1


The following is a pictorial of the verification environment .


For more information on the [fpgalink]() software, firmware, and
general design information see [makestuff]().

uart
----

The myHDL implementation of the  Universal Asynchronous 
Receiver/ Transmitter module
, which is a standard serial communication module between
devices. It uses a FIFOBus interface to communicate with other modules 
externally and also to communicate with other devices. The baudwith 
of the module can be set by setting the baudwidth parameter. UART
reads bit-wise starting on a low signal after which a fixed length
(baudwidth) no of bits can be read, after which the stop high 
signal is received(transmitted).


usbp
----

USB Peripheral, this is another Cypress FX2 controller interface,
this has two interfaces a "control" interface and a "streaming"
interface.  This FX2 interface is intended to work with the
[fx2 firmware]() that configures the controller as a USB CDC/ACM
device (virtual serial port).  The [fx2 firmware]() also has a
couple vendor unique commands that can be sent using the pyusb
(or other low-level USB interfaces like libusb).  The Python
version of the host software (including firmware) can be retrieved
via pip ::

    >> pip install usbp
    >>> import usbp
    >>> import serial

One of the tricky items with USB devices is setting the permissions
correctly.  On a linux system to set the â€¦


spi
---
This is a generic SPI controller.

.. @todo: need more verbage and examples


vga
---
VGA controller.
